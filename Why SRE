How does SRE work:

They automate everything to solve other tasks
They are first responders to maintain SLOs and SLAs that has been promised by the application
Main tasks of SRE:
Fix bugs
Build and deploy software
Test software
Administer production deployment
Manage tooling and provisioning
Mitigate against disasters
Learn and share skills
Analyze past incidents

# Why I want to be SRE:

I love working with large, chaotic systems
I love solving problems which I have never seen before
I love automating and making mundane tasks easy for teams
I am good at collaborating and communicating with engineers to figure out their problems (and hidden ones) and coming up with solutions

# Observability is basically a conversation around the measurement and instrument of an organization.
To improve an organization’s observability, you need to:
- Understand what types of data flow from an environment, and which of those data types are relevant and useful to your observability goals
- Get a clear vision of what a team cares about and figure out how your strategy is making sense of data by distilling, curating, 
transforming it into actionable insights into the performance of your systems.

# A Service Level Indicator (SLI) is a measure of the service level provided by a service provider to a customer. 
SLIs form the basis of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), which in turn form the basis of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). 
An SLI can also be called an SLA metric.

# Although every system is different in the services provided, common SLIs are used pretty often. 
Common SLIs include latency, throughput, availability, and error rate; others include durability (in storage systems), 
end-to-end latency (for complex data processing systems, especially pipelines), and correctness.

# The job role of a Site Reliability Engineer includes the following responsibilities:

- Site reliability engineers communicate with other engineers, product owners, and customers and come up with targets and measures. 
This helps them to ensure system availability. One can easily understand the perfect time to take action 
once all have agreed upon a system’s uptime and availability. 
- They introduce error budgets in order to measure risk, balance availability and feature development. 
- When there are no unrealistic reliability targets, a team has the flexibility to deliver updates and improvements to a system.
- SRE believes in reducing toil. That results in automating tasks that require a human operator to work manually.
- A site reliability engineer should have an in-depth understanding of the systems and their connectivity.
- Site reliability engineers have the task of discovering the problems early to reduce the cost of failure.

# What is Error Budgets? And for what error budgets is used?
- Error budget defines the maximum amount of time a technical system can fail without contractual consequences.
- Error budget encourages the teams to minimize real incidents and maximize innovation by taking risks within acceptable limits.

# Define the Error budget policy?
An error budget policy demonstrates how a business decides to trade off reliability work against other feature work 
when SLO indicates a service is not reliable enough.

# An SLO or Service Level Objective is basically a key element of a service-level agreement (SLA) between a service provider 
and a customer that is agreed upon to measure the performance of service providers and are formed as a way of avoiding disputes. Between two parties.

# SLO can be a specific measurable characteristic of SLA like availability, throughput, frequency, response time, or quality. 
These SLOs togethe define the expected service between the provider and the customer while varying depending on the 
service's urgency, resources, and budget. SLOs provide a quantitative means to define the level of service a customer can expect from a provider.
