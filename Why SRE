# Observability is basically a conversation around the measurement and instrument of an organization.
To improve an organizationâ€™s observability, you need to:
- Understand what types of data flow from an environment, and which of those data types are relevant and useful to your observability goals
- Get a clear vision of what a team cares about and figure out how your strategy is making sense of data by distilling, curating, 
transforming it into actionable insights into the performance of your systems.
