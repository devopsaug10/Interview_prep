Signal Name	Signal Number	Description
SIGHUP	      1	      Hang up detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
SIGINT	      2	      Issued if the user sends an interrupt signal (Ctrl + C)
SIGQUIT	      3	      Issued if the user sends a quit signal (Ctrl + D)
SIGFPE	      8	      Issued if an illegal mathematical operation is attempted
SIGKILL	      9	      If a process gets this signal it must quit immediately and will not perform any clean-up operations
SIGALRM	      14	    Alarm clock signal (used for timers)
SIGTERM	      15	    Software termination signal (sent by kill by default)

Troubleshooting - Best Practice route suggested by Netflix  -> 
Uptime: to get load average which tells what all processes are trying to run on system by CPU demand  
-> dmseg | tail: this gives last 10 commands which were run on machine and bio can see if there was any performance hit in that timeframe  
-> vmstat: this tells the virtual memory in use by processes , there is a newer command available dstat which combines all vmstat (virtual memory), 
iostat (CPU stats), ifstat. With vmstat you can look for r (which is the no of processed running on cpu and wait for their turn), 
free which tells you free memory available, si and so which tells swap in and swap out memory  
-> mpstat: which tells CPU time breakdown and can help us figure out if single CPU has most load   
-> pidstat: rolling process summary, can help us understand which process is using most CPU  
-> iostat: I/o stats   
-> free -m   
-> sar: displays the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. 
Information is reported on the paging system, i/o, CPUs, network interfaces, swap space, file system, and others.   
-> top rolling summary of all the commands which came up virtual memory, swap memory, load avg, cpu usage, process detail
